============================

``quivr`` is a library for working with data-oriented objects in
Python.

The central object in ``quivr`` is the :class:`Table`: a precise
description of the schema for arrays of data, combined with namespaced
methods to keep your code well-structured.

Quivr's tables are :ref:`composable <composition>`.
